                  <p><strong>For many of us, buying a home, particularly our first home, can be an impulsive decision and very much based on emotion. With that in mind, here are some tips that can help home buyers avoid common pitfalls.</strong></p>

                  <h3>Organize your financing in advance</h3>

                  <p>If applicable, contact your mortgage lender to ensure you can obtain financing for any contemplated purchases. The sooner you do this, the better. Many lenders are happy to give buyers pre-approvals.</p>

                  <p>If you are looking to purchase an investment property, explore and carefully consider any potential issues or tax implications.</p>

                  <h3>Visit the property more than once</h3>
                  <p>Request a second visit with a real estate agent outside of normal home opening hours. This will give you a chance to get a good look around the property without other potential buyers getting in the way. It's also a good idea to see the property at different times of the day. This can also give you an idea of ​​whether any traffic outside the property will be of concern in terms of noise and/or privacy.</p>

                  <h3>Always check for maintenance issues</h3>

                  <p>Don't be afraid to be honest and ask the real estate agent about any known issues with the property. It is in your best interest to ask as many questions as you can. Likewise, consider arranging a separate visit with a reputable, qualified builder to provide feedback on the property's condition. We recommend that your purchase offer have a condition added to reflect getting a report from the builder.</p>

                  <p>In our experience, maintenance issues can result in significant costs. It's always best to check this out so you don't have any nasty surprises later on and know exactly what you're signing up for.</p>

                  <h3>Do your research</h3>

                  <p>If you make an offer, make sure that your offer is conditional on obtaining a satisfactory review.</p>

                  <p>Contact one or two insurers to find out if the property is insurable and to get an idea of ​​what your premiums would be for the property you are interested in.</p>

                  <p>Call your local council to find out if any significant work has been approved in the area, as this could affect the value and/or livability of the property.</p>

                  <p>Check that the property has not had any issues recorded on board records (eg flooding, etc.). Obtaining a Land Information Memorandum (LIM) from the municipality would cover these matters and we recommend this as it provides a more comprehensive review of the property and provides any known work that has been completed on it. Again, it is recommended that you ensure that you have a condition entered into your contract when making an offer to purchase.</p>
